# ECG-TimeSeriesAnalysis in Healthcare
In this project, we set out to explore the Electrocardio gram signals using MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and use time series analysis to uncover the complex relation ships of ECG waveforms. We pursue two objectives: to discover the temporal aspects of ECG data, and extract trends, seasonality and make it stationary to perform the prediction on the data
